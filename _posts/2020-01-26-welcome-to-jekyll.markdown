I'm pretty amazed at how blogging has changed over the years.

Not that I ever blogged, but I have had friends who did (do) write blogs and I've done my part of googling out different blogging facilities out there.

There's `Blogger` by Google, `Wix` by wix.com, `Wordpress` by wordpress.com and even weird-ass names like `Joomla`.

And then there's `Jekyll` on which this current blog is written on. And I'm gonna tell you upfront, it's *AMAZING*.

However, setting up Jekyll on a Windows machine is a bit tedious **ONLY** if you've conflicting Ruby packages. I know I had.

However, if you're looking for a good blogging platform that offers `easy customization`,`performance` and `reliability`, I would totally suggest you to check out [Jekyll][jekyll-site].

And although Tom Preston-Werner (GitHub's co-founder) might not be directly responsible for coming up with such a clever name for a simple blogging mechanism, I find it to be a really well-planned name.

After all, Dr.Jekyll and Mr.Hyde does define how each blog is just a reflection of different personalities of the human mind.

**P.S.** My next post will be about how to set-up your Windows machine for blogging using jekyll. Stay tuned!
