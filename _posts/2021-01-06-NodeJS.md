## Happy new year!

This year's the year when vaccines roll out, typescript gets widely adopted and you learn in depth about how `NodeJS` works. Atleast scratch the surface of it's internals.

Let's dive right in.

### What is NodeJS?
According to the Node foundation themselves,
>Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

In simple words, NodeJS is a runtime (think framework) that utilizes V8 engine (think another framework) to help you write OS level operations like accessing files from disks, writing into files, performing networks requests and other I/O operations, __all in javascript__.

Traditionally, C++ was the preferred way (still is, I guess) to perform OS level operations due to high performance of the C++ language. However with the rising popularity of javascript language, developers came up with a way to perform the same operations by writing JS code.

Today, you can write a few lines of javascript to create a file,read/update it and finally delete it without having to write complicated, error-prone C++ code.

### The NodeJS structure

The above image depicts the high level overview of how NodeJS is structured. We write our javascript code in NodeJS, which in turn is executed by the V8 engine and another important module (library) `libUV` which is finally executed by the OS (Windows/Mac/Linux).

So how does the __V8__ and __libUV__ modules fit into the javascript world of NodeJS? Read on!
