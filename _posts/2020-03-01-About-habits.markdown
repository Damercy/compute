I've this `other` blog and I've been ignoring it for a while now, same as this one. And I feel bad simply because I'm unable to keep up with writing simple,*easy* stuff.  

If you know me, then you know that I'm trying to keep myself **busy**, thinking that productivity is just doing *something*. Little did I know that being productive aka being a better version of yourself has nothing to do with keeping yourself busy.  

People are busy everyday but very few of them are productive.  

I need to understand the key difference between productivity and being busy. For then will I be able to modify my system, my brain, myself.  

I want to speak about habits. I know, I know, I'm a terrible guy to speak about habits but hey, it's my own blog afterall.  

I started my first blog a couple of months ago, and in the beginning, the motivation to write was skyrocketing. I would write an article,maybe even two in a day. It's evident from the publishing dates. But with time the motivation faded and I hid this truth behind the excuse that ***"I'm busy,I'll write it later."***.  

The key to getting better, apparently, is to be `consistent`. In my opinion,it even beats the quality of a post. I would much rather prefer posting average articles frequently than great articles rarely.

Right. You see, this is about `building habits`. So consistency (quantity) precides over quality. I want to solve one problem a day over a month than 30 problems for a day. Maybe it's a flawed logic but I'm eager to find out. Verisatium has a cool video on building habits. [Check it out!][to-vs-site]  

So starting today, I will try to be consistent with everything, at least this blog. I'll hit two articles a week and slowly increase my production rate which, be warned, will be based on my schedule. (The internship season is imminent)  

I hope this **plan** works out. If not, well, I'll find another.  

***P.S.*** Sorry for a non-technical blog, but I felt like putting this out in this blog of mine. Thanks for reading!
