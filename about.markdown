Hello there! 

I don't want to waste so much money on learning things that I don't need with money I don't have (thanks, *fightclub*), and so I created this blog.

It's free and it's useful.

This blog helps me to ink down anything I find useful in my everyday search and write about it. I think blogging about the things I like will help me to communicate about a particular technology better in real life. It might also help me to de-clutter from the information overload.

This blog will contain my impressions on technology I've tried, some tutorials and maybe even some algorithms/misc articles.

I hope you find it useful.

Thanks for making it till here!
