Let me begin by addressing the thing that's bugging me..
I know it's been a `while` since I've posted. My last article ( [Javascript.js](https://damercy.github.io/compute/Javascript) ) would make you think that I started on a _js spree_ and never came back.

Well, I came back. But where was I the whole time, you ask?

I was _`learning`_. I was learning JS, diving into  all of the nitty-gritty features ---- IIFE's, Promises, Virtual DOM in React, maps-filters-reducers etc. I have been trying to get comfortable with AWS so that I may be able to deploy the sites (products?) efficiently.

> What is efficient deployment?

To me, it is when different components of a system (for example, a website) communicate with each other (the different modules) with ease, handling all the edge cases of null/undefined/form-manipulation. And do that with security in mind. The last thing I want in my production site branch is to have open ports in the EC2 instance. Hi, hacker.
