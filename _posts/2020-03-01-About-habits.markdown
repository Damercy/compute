I've this other blog and I've been ignoring it for a while now, same as this one. And I feel bad simply because I'm unable to keep up with writing simple,easy stuff.  

If you know me, then you know that I'm trying to keep myself busy, thinking that productivity is just doing *something*. Little did I know that being productive aka being a better version of yourself has nothing to do with keeping yourself busy.  

People are busy everyday but very few of them are productive.  

I need to understand the key difference between productivity and business. For then will I be able to modify my system, my brain, myself.  

I want to speak about habits. I know, I know, I'm a terrible guy to speak about habits but hey, it's my own blog afterall. ;)  

I started my first blog a couple of months ago, and in the beginning, the motivation to write was skyrocketing. I would write an article,maybe even two, in a day. It's evident from the publishing dates.
